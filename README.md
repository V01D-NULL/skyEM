# skyEM
skyEM is a game emulator, that runs in 16 bit real mode.
It can be run off of a floppy disk (not tested), usb drive (not tested), and an emulator.
The emulator used for testing is Qemu --> qemu-system-i386 -fda bin/skyEM.img


What does "skyEM" mean?
  `skyEM stands for Skyline Emulator`

I would like to contribute, what can I do?
  - If you want to help me out, do some bug testing and enjoy skyEM's games!

NOTE: This does not emulate any device, it just try's to emulate retro games as best it can

This project is NOT finished -> ((VERY) Early stage of development - Do not expect flawless and pretty formatted code)
